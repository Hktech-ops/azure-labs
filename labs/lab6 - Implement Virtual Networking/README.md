## Problem Statement:

Your global organization plans to implement virtual networks. The immediate goal is to accommodate all the existing resources. However, the organization is in a growth phase and wants to ensure there is additional capacity for the growth.

The CoreServicesVnet virtual network has the largest number of resources. A large amount of growth is anticipated, so a large address space is necessary for this virtual network.

The ManufacturingVnet virtual network contains systems for the operations of the manufacturing facilities. The organization is anticipating a large number of internal connected devices for their systems to retrieve data from.
